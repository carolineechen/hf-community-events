Runhouse lets you send code and data to any of your compute or data infra (with your own cloud creds), all in
Python, and continue to use them eagerly exactly as they were. With support for both on-demand clusters (with built
in autostop feature) and bring-your-own cluster, running code on your cluster is as easy as
`my_local_function.to(cluster)` or `my_local_folder.to(cluster, path_on_cluster)`.
